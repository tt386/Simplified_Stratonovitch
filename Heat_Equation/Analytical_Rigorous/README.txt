First, I created ChangingCharacteristic directory - this shows a the minimum has a linear dependence with respect to the root of the diffusion constant.

Then I created the Changing_OSR, to see if I can discern any functional relationships. In this, I created the Parallel mothod for working.

Then I created the Changing_PAP - I can't discern much of a functional relationship. I used the Parallel version from previous.
