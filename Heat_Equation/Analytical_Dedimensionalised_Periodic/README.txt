The most important scripts, in order of creation:

1) Single_Year - here I parallelise over different rho values and find the minima curves for each rho - from here I identify 'kinks' in the curve that bounds the minimum of the curve

2) Small_rho and Large_rho: theoretical treatment predict how the kinks behave in the limits of high and small rho values - it is worth studying this to ascertain the theory's region of applicability.
